# Project Proposal

For the project, we are proposing the creation of a website for Temple Cats. Temple Cats is a small TNR rescue around Temple’s main campus, with approximately 16 colony locations for feral cats. The website should be an introduction to students of the colonies. The homepage will an active slideshow of the colony cats. There could be a “kitty graveyard” type area of the website that contains all cats who have passed or been adopted. The location of noncurrent colony cats has yet to be decided. The dedicated colony pages will also have links to a wishlist/active donation links, so viewers can make donations, or alternatively, buy cat supplies straight out. However, the site needs a way to be updated weekly. Each colony page will have dedicated weekly updates, with status of the cats, as well as new images. The website is also meant to be a resource for Temple students who want to get cats, and there needs to be a way to allow large amounts of information.

# Vision

Warm-hearted, animal loving college students and faculty with a desire to help their local feline community need basic information on where their services are most necessary. The Temple Cats website is a Web-based service that
provides critical information regarding the local cat communities including location information, veterinary contact information, and first aid guidance that improve cat prosperity at critical touch points. Unlike other websites dedicated to cat prosperity, our website provides very detailed, geographically relevant, and practical services for free.

large public university in the heart of bustling North Philadelphia. He spends most of his time procrastinating from studying by watching cat videos on YouTube. He was born in a rural town northwest of Philadelphia, where his father 
runs a bakery and his mother is a school nurse. Jason’s family had a myriad of pets growing up, making Jason an avid animal lover from the time he was a young boy.


Jason’s long history with pets means has made him quite fond of being a pet owner. He greatly desires to have pets of his own; however, it is against the terms of the lease he signed with the university. He is particularly interested in using the Temple Cats website to gain more information on how he can begin caring for a cat community near his dorm.

Emily is a sophomore in college. She is going for a walk in the evening, and finds a small orange kitten huddled in a pile of trash. She approaches it with food, and finds out that it is extremely friendly. She comes back with a cardboard box and carries it home. She quickly googles the basic needs of a cat and creates a makeshift litter box, and buys some cheap dry food from the nearest convenience store.

This page tells her about contact info as well as any activities that are going on in which she may be able to participate. She contacts them and the organization asks if she could drive supplies from one place to another. She agrees and checks the events section to figure out where she needs to go.
