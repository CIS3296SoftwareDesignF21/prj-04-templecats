# Project Proposal

For the project, we are proposing the creation of a website for Temple Cats. Temple Cats is a small TNR rescue around Temple’s main campus, with approximately 16 colony locations for feral cats. The website should be an introduction to students of the colonies. The homepage will an active slideshow of the colony cats. There could be a “kitty graveyard” type area of the website that contains all cats who have passed or been adopted. The location of noncurrent colony cats has yet to be decided. The dedicated colony pages will also have links to a wishlist/active donation links, so viewers can make donations, or alternatively, buy cat supplies straight out. However, the site needs a way to be updated weekly. Each colony page will have dedicated weekly updates, with status of the cats, as well as new images. The website is also meant to be a resource for Temple students who want to get cats, and there needs to be a way to allow large amounts of information.
